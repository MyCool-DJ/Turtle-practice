# Turning ⏎ & 🧭 Co-ordinates

### 🥷 **YWBAT**
(This stands for *YOU WILL BE ABLE TO*).  

**In this project, YWBAT:**
+ learn to use angles & co-ordinates
+ organise your code using `#comments`
+ work with various files & change the background image
  
## 👩‍💻 Project Mission 👨‍💻
**Using our turtle to draw triangles and other shapes!**

## 🏗️ Setting up our project 
Before we start working with Turtle, we need to set Turtle up! 

🏗️ Create a file called `setup.py` and write `from setup import *` at the top of your `main.py`.

🏗️ Copy and paste the segment of code below in your `setup.py` file.

✂️
>```py
>#Importing turtle
>from turtle import *
>
>#Screen size
>setup(1.0, 1.0)
>```


### 🦉 Let's change the background before we get started:

🚩 Write the command `bgpic ('')` in your `setup.py`

Take a peek at your file tree, you should notice a couple of .png files. Find one picture that you like!

🚩 Inside of the quotations of `bgpic('')`, write the name of the picture you like. 

*Eg: `bgpic('Constellation_2.png')`*

🦉 Changing the background images can make our canvases a little more interesting. They can also help us understand some concepts a little better and faster!

### 🦉 We can also change the shape of our turtle.

Right now our turtle has the shape of an arrow, let's change it to the shape of a turtle!

🚩 Write the command `shape("")` in your `setup.py`

🚩 Inside of the quotations of `shape("")`, write `turtle`

*Eg: `shape("turtle")`*

### Nice Work 👏 Let's move onto our challenges.
