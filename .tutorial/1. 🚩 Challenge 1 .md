# 🚩 Challenge 1 
## Turning with Turtle 📐

When we want to turn our turtle so that it faces a different direction, we can use the `left()` and `right()` commands.

🚩 Try to turn the turtle with either the `left()` or `right()` command.

### You should see that we got an error! 👾

We have told the turtle the direction we want to turn in, but we have not told it how much we want it to turn in that direction! 

Turtle uses degrees as a measurement for turning (like angles). If you wanted your turtle to do a full turn and face in the opposite direction, you could either use `left(180)` or `right(180)`!

🚩 Use either the `left()` or `right()` command to make your turtle face upwards.


## Moving with Turtle ⏩
Now that we've learnt how to turn with turtle, let's see how we can move forwards and backwards.

To move forwards we can use the command `forward()` and to move backwards we can use the command `backward()`. Like the `left()` and `right()` commands, we need to tell the turtle how much we want to move either forwards or backwards.

🚩 Move the turtle forward 100 units.

You should see that your turtle has moved forward and has drawn a line to where it has moved. Nice! We can use this to draw anything we want!

🚩 Turn the turtle 45 degrees to the left and then move backward 50 units. 

### Great job! Let's try to draw a triangle now.
