# 🚩 Challenge 1 
## Turning with Turtle 📐

We use the `left()` and `right()` commands to turn our.

1. 🚩 Change your `bgpic('')` to `1.sand.png`.

2. 🚩 Change your turtle's `pensize()` and `color("")`
3. 🚩 Experiment with the `penup()` and `pendown()`commands
   
4. 🚩 Try to turn the turtle with either the `left()` or `right()` command.

*💡 Remember to add a value to determine the angle.*

🦉 Turtle uses degrees as a measurement for turning (like angles). 

*💡 Remember to add a value to determine the angle.*

4. 🚩Draw a light green 45° angle
5. 🚩Draw a sea green 30° angle
6. 🚩Draw a green 120° angle
7. 🚩Draw a dark green 90° angle
8. 🚩Draw a yellow green 360° angle

🦉 If you're unsure of how to visualise the angles you can change the background picture to the `2.turning_circle.png.` to assist.

### Great job! Let's try to draw a triangle now.
