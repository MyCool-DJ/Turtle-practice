# 🚩 Challenge 3

Let's take our drawing ability to the next level and draw a constellation in the stars!

🚩 Change the background picture to either `4.stars.png` or `5.constellation.png`. 

🚩Change your turtle's `color('')` and `pensize()` to be visible in the stars.

### HACK time 👾

🚩 Copy & Paste ✂️ this code snippet into your `setup.py`
```py
# Print coordinate where clicked:
onscreenclick(lambda x,y: print("x: %d, y: %d" % (x, y)))
```

🚩 Use the `penup()`, `pendown()` and `goto()` commands to draw a "✨Constellation Algorithm" in the stars.
