# ðŸš© Challenge 3
Let's now test our drawing ability and draw a constellation in the stars!

ðŸš© Change the background picture to either `Constellation_1.png` or `Constellation_2.png`. *If you are already using one then don't worry!*

ðŸš© Use the `penup()`, `pendown()` and `goto()` commands to draw a constellation in the stars. To do this, connect the stars to each other with turtle.
