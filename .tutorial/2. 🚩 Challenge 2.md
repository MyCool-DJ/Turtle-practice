# 🚩 Challenge 2

### We can also directly move our turtle! 📍

🦉 The `goto()` command instructs turtle to move to a specific location on our screen. 

*This location is determined by a `x` and `y` coordinate.*

#### The background picture `bgpic("3.plane.png") splits the screen into 4 quadrants 📝:

- The Top Left quadrant will have: (-x,y) coordinates
- The Top Right quadrant will have: (x,y) coordinates
- The Bottom Left will have: (-x,-y) coordinates
- The Bottom Right will have: (x,-y) coordinates

1. 🚩 Stamp a turtle in each quadrant using the `goto()` `stamp()` function
   
2. 🚩 Use the `penup()` function to ensure your turtle "jumps" across the plane.

## Fill Color Command 🎨

3. 🚩 Draw a purple circle.

🦉 To color shapes you use **3 commands**:

- The `fillcolor` command followed by your color choice: 

`fillcolor('purple')`  


- Now you instruct the computer to start coloring by using the `begin_fill` command with empty brackets: 

`begin_fill()`  

- Finally, instruct the computer to stop colouring in the shape by using the `end_fill` command and empty brackets:   

`end_fill()`  

<details> <summary> 💡 Hint: </summary>

  To create a purple circle, we would write our code like this.
</details>


```py
#color
fillcolor('purple')
begin_fill()
circle (30)
end_fill()
```

4. 🚩 Draw a purple circle in (x,y)
5. 🚩 Draw a magenta circle in (x,-y)
6. 🚩 Draw a violet circle in (-x,-y)
7. 🚩 Draw a blueviolet circle in (x,-y)
