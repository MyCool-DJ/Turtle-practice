# 🚩 Challenge 2

🚩 Draw a triangle with each side being 100 units long.

### We can also directly move our turtle! 📍
The `goto()` command tells our turtle to move to a location on our turtle screen. This location is determined by a `x` and `y` coordinate.

*Eg: `goto(0, 10)` will send the turtle 0 units in the x direction and 10 units upwards in the y direction!*

🚩 Use the `goto()` command to go to the coordinate x = 50 and y = -100.

### What if we want to stop drawing? 🤔
There is even a command that lets us stop drawing in case we just want to reposition our turtle to draw something else!

The `penup()` command tells our turtle to stop drawing when moving (like taking the pen away from the page). We can then use the `pendown()` command to put our pen back down on the page and our turtle will start drawing again whenever it moves.

🚩 Draw a line 50 units forward, then move 50 units without drawing and then draw another line 50 units forward.
